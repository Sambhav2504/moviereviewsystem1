Movie Review System
Overview
The Movie Review System is a Java-based application designed to manage user reviews, ratings, and related data for movies. This project leverages Hibernate for object-relational mapping (ORM), MySQL for database management, and Maven for build automation. It was developed as a collaborative effort to enhance development efficiency and code maintainability.
Tech Stack

Languages: Java (OOP, Collections, Exception Handling)
Frameworks & Libraries: Hibernate, Maven
Databases: MySQL
Tools: Git, GitHub

Features

Designed and implemented ORM using Hibernate to model users, reviews, and ratings as Java entities.
Utilized Hibernate APIs (Session, Transaction, Query) to perform all CRUD operations.
